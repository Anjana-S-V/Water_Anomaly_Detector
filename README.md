#  Sensor-Based Leak Detection using Machine Learning

An unsupervised machine learning project that detects potential leaks or abnormal behavior in sensor data using **flow rate** and **pressure** readings.  
The system uses **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection and **interactive visualizations** for analysis.

##  Problem Statement

Fluid systems such as water pipelines and industrial networks often experience leaks that go unnoticed until they cause major losses.  
Traditional threshold-based monitoring fails due to natural fluctuations in sensor data.

This project uses **machine learning–based anomaly detection** to automatically identify abnormal sensor behavior without relying on fixed rules or labeled data.

##  Objectives

- Detect potential leaks from sensor data
- Work without labeled datasets
- Provide clear visual insights
- Enable model reuse and deployment


##  Methodology

The project uses **Isolation Forest**, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that:
- Isolates rare and abnormal data points
- Performs well on sensor and IoT data
- Does not require predefined thresholds



##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Plotly  
- Pickle
